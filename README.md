## This document
This is just an example document to show some basic markdown syntax such as *Italics*, **Bold** and _Underscore_.

> This is a blokquote

And this is an ordered list
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

While this is an unordered list
- Something
- Something different
- Something really different

This is a code block

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Title</title>
      </head>
    </html>

This is also code
